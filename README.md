Brain Tumor Segmentation using YOLOv11 and SAM2
Name: Danish Imtiaz
Internship Company: Arch Technologies
Start Date: June 3, 2025
End Date: June 4, 2025

Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying and segmenting brain tumors from MRI images using two powerful computer vision models: YOLOv11 for object detection and SAM2 (Segment Anything Model 2) for segmentation. The goal is to automate and improve accuracy in medical image analysis.
Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- OpenCV
- YOLOv11
- SAM2 (Segment Anything Model)
Implementation Steps
1. Collected a brain tumor image dataset from open-source repositories.
2. Trained YOLOv11 model to detect tumor regions.
3. Applied SAM2 on the YOLO-detected regions for detailed segmentation.
4. Evaluated segmentation results using Intersection over Union (IoU).
5. Visualized the output with overlaid segmented tumors.
Evaluation
The Intersection over Union (IoU) metric was used to assess segmentation accuracy. Visual comparisons were made between the predicted tumor masks and the ground truth.
Conclusion
This internship project provided hands-on experience with modern computer vision techniques. YOLOv11 and SAM2 proved effective for brain tumor detection and segmentation. The combination of these models enhances precision in medical imaging applications.
